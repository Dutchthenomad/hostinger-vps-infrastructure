## How to Import into draw.io

### Method 1: Mermaid Import (Recommended)
1. Open draw.io (app.diagrams.net)
2. Go to **Arrange → Insert → Advanced → Mermaid**
3. Paste the contents of the `.mmd` file
4. Click **Insert**
5. Adjust layout as needed

### Method 2: Use mermaid.live First
1. Go to [mermaid.live](https://mermaid.live)
2. Paste the `.mmd` content
3. Export as SVG
4. Import SVG into draw.io

## Editing Tips

- **Subgraphs** become grouped containers in draw.io
- **Styling classes** may not transfer - reapply colors manually
- **Direction** (TB/LR) controls flow orientation

## Rendering in GitHub/VSCode

These `.mmd` files render natively in:
- GitHub markdown (wrap in ```mermaid code blocks)
- VSCode with Mermaid extension
- Obsidian, Notion, etc.
