COMPREHENSIVE FORENSIC AUDIT REPORT
Rugs.fun - Solana Web3 Game Platform
Audit Date: December 25, 2025
Platform: https://rugs.fun/
Git Hash: 24a87a7

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This forensic audit examined the blockchain systems, wallet integration, transaction flows, and trust model of Rugs.fun, a Solana-based web3 gaming platform. The platform implements a hybrid custodial model using Privy for wallet management with an internal balance system that raises significant trust and security concerns.

1. WALLET + SIGNING FLOW ANALYSIS
Wallet Integration Architecture

Primary Wallet Provider: Phantom Wallet (confirmed via window.solana.isPhantom)
Wallet Management Layer: Privy (custodial/MPC wallet infrastructure)
Connector Type: solana_adapter via Privy
Authentication: Multi-token system (access token, refresh token, ID token, PAT)

Privy Configuration Detected
Application ID: cm826jprh00ntnjodv1etxlfl
Active Connection: phantom:F1gi7o5WMyYrwK9MvPpgLm6aEkpTtW3xSrjHrt92pq1M
Connector: solana_adapter
Wallet Client: phantom
Connected: 1766703746858 (Unix timestamp)
Signing Functions Available

window.solana.signTransaction() - Single transaction signing
window.solana.signAllTransactions() - Batch signing
window.solana.signAndSendTransaction() - Sign + broadcast
window.solana.signMessage() - Message signing for authentication

🚩 RED FLAG: Custodial Balance System
The platform uses an internal balance system (0.000 SOL displayed) rather than direct wallet interactions. This means:

Users must DEPOSIT funds into the platform's custody
Game transactions occur off-chain or within a custodial pool
WITHDRAW required to return funds to user's wallet
Trust Model: Users must trust the platform to hold funds securely


2. BLOCKCHAIN CALLS & PROGRAM IDs
Solana Program Integration

Solana Vendor Bundle: solana-vendor-DdXKLSVR.js (contains Solana Web3.js library)
Program IDs Detected: 24 unique Solana addresses found in vendor bundle (blocked from display for security)
Transaction Construction: Client-side (JavaScript-based using Solana Web3.js)

Key Observations

Transactions are built client-side in the browser
Signing occurs through Privy's wallet adapter
No direct RPC calls captured during testing period (suggests WebSocket-based communication or deferred transaction execution)

Infrastructure
Tech Stack:
- React (UI framework)
- Material-UI (mui-vendor)
- PixiJS (graphics engine - pixi-vendor)
- State Management (state-vendor) 
- Solana Web3.js (solana-vendor)
- WalletConnect (integration detected)
- Privy Auth (auth-vendor)

3. CROSS-PROGRAM INVOCATIONS (CPIs)
Limitations
Due to the custodial balance system, no live blockchain transactions were captured during the audit period. The following analysis is based on infrastructure detection:
Likely Program Interactions (Inference-based)
Given the gaming context and infrastructure:

SPL Token Program: For SOL transfers and potential token operations
Game Logic Program: Custom Solana program for game mechanics (not observed directly)
Potential VRF/Oracle: For randomness generation (see Section 5)

🚩 RED FLAG: Opacity
Without capturing actual transactions, it's impossible to verify:

Which programs are being invoked
Whether CPIs are occurring
Compute budget usage
Account metadata
Instruction data structures


4. OFF-CHAIN COMPUTE & HIDDEN APIs
Telemetry Infrastructure (OpenTelemetry Implementation)
The platform has extensive monitoring:
Endpoints Detected:
- https://telemetry.rugs.fun/v1/traces
- https://telemetry.rugs.fun/v1/metrics  
- https://telemetry.rugs.fun/v1/logs
Telemetry Captures:

User interactions (ClickLogger with device/browser fingerprinting)
Network latency (PingService)
Offline tracking
Socket.IO instrumentation
Browser performance metrics

🚩 RED FLAG: Data Collection
Extensive telemetry suggests:

User behavior tracking
Performance profiling
Potential game state monitoring server-side

Hidden APIs (Not Directly Observed)
The custodial model implies backend APIs for:

Deposit/Withdraw processing
Game settlement (bet processing, payouts)
Balance management
Authentication/session management (Privy integration)

Network Infrastructure

WalletConnect: pulse.walletconnect.org (project ID: 34357d3c125c2bcf2ce2bc3309d98715)
CDN: Cloudflare (beacon.min.js detected)
Chat System: Real-time chat via Socket.IO
Intercom: Customer support widget (d0omojfl)


5. RANDOMNESS & FAIRNESS AUDIT
⚠️ CRITICAL CONCERN: Unverifiable Randomness
Observations:

"Provably Fair" Button Present - The UI includes a "Provably Fair Information" button, but its implementation could not be audited without triggering transactions
Game Mechanics - The platform appears to be a multiplier-based game where:

Users BUY/SELL positions
Multipliers increase over time
Game "crashes" at unpredictable points
"Golden Hour" events with prize drawings


Randomness Source: Unknown

Cannot verify if randomness is:

Generated on-chain (VRF program)
Generated server-side (centralized)
Deterministically reproducible
Known before user commitment





🚩 RED FLAGS for Fairness

Custodial model = platform controls fund flow
Client-side JavaScript = game logic potentially manipulable
No observable on-chain settlement = results could be determined off-chain
Privy integration = transactions may be pre-approved without user explicit signing

Trust Dependencies
Users must trust:

Rugs.fun backend for fair randomness
Privy for secure wallet management
Platform custodianship of deposited funds
Correctness of "Provably Fair" implementation (if any)


6. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE SUMMARY
Application Stack
Frontend:
├── React + Material-UI
├── PixiJS (game graphics)
├── Solana Web3.js
├── WalletConnect/AppKit
├── Privy Authentication
└── OpenTelemetry monitoring

Backend (Inferred):
├── Game state server
├── Custodial wallet system
├── Telemetry ingestion
├── Socket.IO real-time services
└── Privy policy/approval APIs
Transaction Flow (Theoretical)
1. User connects Phantom via Privy
2. User deposits SOL → Platform custody
3. Game bets use internal balance (off-chain ledger)
4. Game results computed (server-side?)
5. Balance updated in platform database
6. User withdraws → On-chain Solana transaction

7. TRUST MODEL ANALYSIS
Centralization Points

Privy MPC Wallets - Third-party custody layer
Internal Balance System - Platform holds user funds
Game Logic Server - Outcome determination
Randomness Generation - Source unverified

On-Chain vs Off-Chain

DEPOSIT/WITHDRAW: On-chain Solana transactions
GAME PLAY: Appears to be off-chain (custodial balance manipulation)
SETTLEMENT: Likely off-chain database updates

Conclusion: This is NOT a fully on-chain game. It is a hybrid custodial platform with on-chain entry/exit points but off-chain gameplay.

8. RED FLAGS & SECURITY CONCERNS
🔴 Critical Issues

Custodial Risk - Users lose custody of funds during gameplay
Unverified Fairness - Cannot independently audit randomness or game outcomes
Privy Dependency - Third-party controls wallet signing flow
Extensive Telemetry - User behavior tracking and fingerprinting
Opaque Settlement - Game results not observable on-chain

⚠️ Moderate Concerns

WebSocket Communication - Game state updates via Socket.IO (encrypted but opaque)
Client-Side Transaction Building - Potential for manipulation or bugs
No Rate Limiting Observable - Deposit/withdrawal protections unclear
WalletConnect Integration - Additional attack surface

ℹ️ Informational

Chat System - Real-time user communication (potential for social engineering)
Leaderboard System - PnL tracking (privacy implications)
Level/XP System - Gamification encouraging continued play


9. SAMPLE TRANSACTION ANALYSIS
⚠️ Unable to Capture Live Transactions
Reason: The platform requires funds in custody (0.000 SOL balance) to trigger actual blockchain transactions. During the audit period:

DEPOSIT button was non-responsive or requires additional authentication
BUY/SELL buttons do not trigger transactions with zero balance
No wallet signature prompts were generated

Transaction Hooks Installed:

window.solana.signTransaction - Hooked ✅
window.solana.signAndSendTransaction - Hooked ✅
No transactions captured during audit window


10. RECOMMENDATIONS
For Users:

Understand the trust model - You are trusting Rugs.fun and Privy with custody
Verify "Provably Fair" - Check if the fairness mechanism is actually auditable
Limit deposits - Only deposit what you can afford to lose
Review Privy permissions - Understand what transaction authority you've granted
Monitor withdrawals - Ensure you can actually withdraw funds

For the Platform:

Publish program IDs - Make Solana programs open-source for auditing
Implement on-chain settlement - Move game logic to Solana programs
Use verifiable VRF - Integrate Switchboard/Pyth for provable randomness
Minimize custodial holdings - Allow users to play directly from wallets
Transparency - Document the trust model clearly for users

For Auditors:

Fund test account - Deposit SOL to capture actual transactions
Monitor RPC calls - Use network inspection to capture Solana JSON-RPC
Decompile programs - If program IDs are found, analyze bytecode
Test withdrawal flow - Verify users can actually exit with funds


11. CONCLUSIONS
Game Classification: Hybrid Custodial
Rugs.fun is not a fully on-chain Solana game. It implements a custodial balance system where:

Entry/exit points use Solana blockchain
Gameplay and settlement appear to be off-chain
Users must trust the platform for fair outcomes

Privy/MPC Trust Model Impact
Privy adds a layer of abstraction that:

✅ Simplifies wallet onboarding
✅ Enables social login integration
❌ Introduces third-party custody risk
❌ May enable transaction pre-approval without explicit signing
❌ Creates additional centralization

Fairness: Unverifiable
Without capturing actual transactions and analyzing on-chain state, game fairness cannot be independently verified. The "Provably Fair" claim requires deeper investigation.
Overall Assessment
⚠️ MEDIUM-HIGH RISK - The platform's custodial model and opaque game mechanics create significant trust dependencies. Users should be aware they are effectively playing on a centralized platform with blockchain entry/exit points, not a fully decentralized on-chain game.
